1. Decomposition (Nedbrytning)

Use ChatGPT to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.

structure chaos

separate subproblems

make the unclear understandable

This is the foundation for all advanced problem-solving, both in programming, mathematics, and analysis.

2. Explanation (Förklaring)

Use ChatGPT to get explanations from multiple perspectives.

why something works

how different parts connect

alternative ways to understand the same thing

This strengthens conceptual understanding, not just memorized knowledge.

3. Validation (Prövning & kontroll)

Use ChatGPT to test reasoning, assumptions, and logic.

question your own conclusions

find logical gaps

compare solutions

Here, AI acts as an intellectual mirror, not a final answer.

4. Reflection (Metakognition)

Use ChatGPT to identify what you do not understand yet.

knowledge gaps

weak assumptions

unclear connections

This is the most underrated part — and the one that separates real learning from shallow consumption.

Summary in one line

ChatGPT is best used as a tool for decomposition, explanation, validation, and reflection.

That is exactly why AI in your context does not replace thinking, but strengthens it.
